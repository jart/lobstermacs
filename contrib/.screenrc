## jart's .screenrc file

# screen is one of the best tools you can possibly use on Linux,
# especially if you SSH into lots of servers.  It lets you have lots
# of bash shells open simultaneously within the same terminal,
# creating a little tab at the bottom of the screen for each one.
# Most importantly if your SSH connection drops, you can log back in
# an hour later and your screen session will be waiting for you, 100%
# in-tact :)

# This screenrc has been tested extensively with gnome-terminal and
# Mac OS X's terminal.  I'm sure it works great in Putty too.

## GETTING STARTED

# cp lobstermacs/contrib/.screenrc ~/.screenrc
# screen -DR

## WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

# While inside GNU screen, backtic '`' is intercepted by screen so you
# can tell it to do things.  If you want to type this character
# normally, press it twice.  See `man screen` for more information.

# ` n: Go to Next window
# ` p: Go to Previous screen
# ` k: Kill current window
# ` A: Change title of current screen
# ` d: Detach screen and go back to normal terminal (you can reattach
       again later using screen -DR)
# ` [: Freezes screen so you can use the arrow keys to scroll around
       and look for information.  Press '?' to start searching
       backward and `/` to search forward (vi shortcuts)  You can also
       use the scroll wheel.  Press <enter> a bunch of times to leave
       this mode.

## XTERM TWEAKS

# These are very important if you want emacs keyboard shortcuts to
# behave normally

#xterm understands both im/ic and doesn't have a status line.
#Note: Do not specify im and ic in the real termcap/info file as
#some programs (e.g. vi) will not work anymore.
